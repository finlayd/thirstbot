You found Thirstbot!
=================
This bot was created to help moderate and bring some fun features to the thirstserv discord server

https://discord.gg/7A4y2VY
=================

*it is very important to stress: this does not represent my ability to produce proffessionally polished applications for public use. This was a rushed, personal project that acted more as an experiment with nodejs for me rather than to produce a well functioning program. As a result, many of the features are hardcoded to work in 1 server setup in a specific way, and many of the features do not function smoothly.*

What it does
------------
1. last-message gamemode
2. count to 1000 gamemode
3. chat binds that can be used by everyone
4. moderator commands including
    - dm multiple users diff messages from 1 command











cheers Glitch.com, heroku.com, discordjs and countless stackedoveflow and reddit users for ~~letting me steal your code and exploit your services~~ helping me
